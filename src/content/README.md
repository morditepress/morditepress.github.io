# Vault CMS: Preconfigured Slate Theme

This is a preconfigured [Vault CMS](https://github.com/davidvkimball/vault-cms) instance for the [Slate](https://github.com/setstatic/slate) Astro theme.

## How to Use This Example

1. **Copy the contents** of this folder (not the folder itself) into your Slate theme project.
2. Paste them into your `src/content` folder.   

> [!warning]
> Copy the `.obsidian` and `_bases/`, folders directly into `src/content/`, not the parent `slate` folder.

3. Open Obsidian and select "Open folder as vault", then select your `src/content` folder.
4. The vault is preconfigured for Slate and ready to use!

## What's Included

This example includes:
- Preconfigured `.obsidian` vault with plugins and settings optimized for Slate
- Example content structure matching Slate's expected format
- A `_bases/` folder with a `Home.base` file for content management
