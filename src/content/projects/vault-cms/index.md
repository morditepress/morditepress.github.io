## Project Overview

Vault CMS (formerly Obsidian Astro Suite) is a collection of pre-configured Obsidian vaults designed to seamlessly integrate with Astro static sites. It provides a complete content management solution that bridges the gap between note-taking and web publishing, with three optimized vault options: **Default**, **Minimal**, and **Docs**.

## Philosophy

Vault CMS is built on three core principles:

1. **Plug-and-play Astro blogging experience** - Pre-configured vaults ready for immediate use
2. **Emphasis on customization and modularity** - Flexible configuration for different use cases
3. **Visual parity between backend and frontend** - Seamless workflow from Obsidian to Astro publishing

## Vault Options

### Default
Optimized for general-purpose Astro blogs, configured for the Slate blog theme.

### Minimal
Optimized for minimal Astro themes, prioritizing visual minimalism and distraction-free writing, configured for the Chiri theme.

### Docs
Optimized for Starlight and other documentation-focused Astro themes.

## Included Community Plugins

### Image & Media Management

## Technical Implementation

The suite is built on Obsidian's plugin ecosystem and designed to work with Astro's content collections system. It provides a complete development environment for content creators who want to use Obsidian as their primary writing tool, with seamless integration that requires no link conversion or manual configuration.

## Installation & Setup

2. Clone or download Vault CMS repository
3. Open the folder of the version you want (Default, Minimal, or Docs)
